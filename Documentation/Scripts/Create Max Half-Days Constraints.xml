 * Max Half-Days Constraint
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The MaxHalfDays constraint limits the number of half-days of week during which
 * the given set of classes are taught.
 * It has one parameter: a maximal number of week half-days during which the given
 * set of classes can be placed.
 * A day is split by noon (which can be changed using General.HalfDaySlot parameter).
 * A class starting before noon is considered a morning class (despite of its end),
 * a class starting at noon or later is considered an afternoon class
 * For instance, a reference MaxHalfDays:4 translates to a maximum number of 4 half-days
 * a week.
