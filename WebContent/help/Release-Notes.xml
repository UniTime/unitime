<release>
	<version>4.8.${build.number}</version>
	<release-date>${build.date}</release-date>
	<category>
		<title>Course Timetabling</title>
		<item>
			<name>Class Assignment: Room Partitions</name>
			<description>
				<line>Consider room partitions when checking room availability (other non-class events).</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Multiple Class Setup: Room-related Columns</name>
			<description>
				<line>In order to be consistent with the Instructional Offering Configuration page, the order of the room-related columns changed to be: Nbr Rooms, Splt Attd, and Room Ratio.
					<line>Instead of Room Ratio, Nbr Rooms, and Splt Attd.</line>
				</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Edit Scheduling Subpart: Subpart Credit</name>
			<description>
				<line>Max Units made editable when editing Variable Min/Max credit without the need to change the credit type first (when editing existing credit information).</line>
				<line>Fixed an issue when no units or max units are provided (for a type that requires units/max units) or when the provided units are not a number.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling Solver: Optimization</name>
			<description>
				<line>In order for the solver to start optimization even when a complete solution cannot be found, added an ability to halt the initial search phase when a maximum number of non-improving iterations is reached.</line>
				<line>This can be controlled by the Search.MaxIdleIterations parameter.
					<line>It defaults to 1000.</line>
					<line>Set to -1 to disable the ability to halt the initial search phase (previous behavior).</line>
					<line>Set to 0 to disable the construction heuristics, going directly to the optimization phases.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added an ability to disable the max-idle limitation during the first part of the search, effectively setting up a minimal construction time.
					<line>Parameter Search.MinConstructionTime, which can be in seconds or in percentage of the total time (Termination.TimeOut).</line>
					<line>Defaults to 10% of the total time limit. So, if max-idle is enabled, it will not stop construction or the IFS phase during the first 10% time of the solver run.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Improved the ability to assign an unassigned class during the optimization phase.
					<line>To enable this, add ;org.cpsolver.coursett.neighbourhoods.Suggestion@0.1 to the following parameters:
						<line>HillClimber.AdditionalNeighbours</line>
						<line>GreatDeluge.AdditionalNeighbours</line>
						<line>SimulatedAnnealing.AdditionalNeighbours</line>
					</line>
					<line>This is especially needed when the construction phase is disabled, or the solver struggles to find a complete solution when one exists.</line>
				</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling Solver: Random Student Swap Selection</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added a neighborhood selection that attempts to swap a student between alternative sections of a course.</line>
				<line>To be used with the Hill Climber (HC), Great Deluge (GD), or Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms.
					<line>Enable by adding the RandomStudentSwap class to the AdditionalNeighbours properties.</line>
				</line>
				<line>The selection is only available/enabled when the solver is using a single thread as student class assignments are not included in the solution/</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling Solver: Simulated Annealing</name>
			<description>
				<line>Various improvements and changes in an attempt to make the SA algorithm more reliable.</line>
				<line>Added minimal and maximal temperature.</line>
				<line>Improved temperature training (when SimulatedAnnealing.InitialTemperature is set to -1)</line>

		<title>Student Scheduling</title>
		<item>
			<name>Student Scheduling Solver: Linked Classes</name>
			<description>
				<line>Allow one class to be present in multiple Linked Classes distributions between the same two courses.</line>
				<line>This allows for the Linked Classes to overlap with each other, e.g., when most classes can be linked one-to-one, but there are exceptions (e.g., one course has an additional course that can be used with any class of the other course).</line>

		<item>
			<name>Extended Student Conflicts</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added an experimental global constraint that does not allow any two classes that the same student can attend to have a conflict.</line>
				<line>The constraint checks any two classes of different offerings that share at least one student and that the student is allowed to take (not restricted by reservations).
					<line>Class pairs included in the Ignore Student Conflicts constraints are ignored.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Some classes may be excluded by using ExtendedStudentConflicts.IgnoreClasses parameter which may contain a regular expression matching class name(s).</line>
				<line>Pairs of classes of the same offering are checked, too.
					<line>In this case, the course structure must allow the two classes to be attended together (e.g., they are from the same configuration),</line>
					<line>and at least one student in the offering is allowed to take both classes.</line>
					<line>This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting ExtendedStudentConflicts.CheckSameCourse to false.</line>
				</line>	
				<line>To enable this constraint, add org.cpsolver.coursett.constraint.ExtendedStudentConflicts to General.GlobalConstraints
					(which contains a semicolon separated list of global constraint classes that should be automatically added to the problem)</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Room Edit: Room Features &amp; Groups</name>
			<description>
				<line>Disabled pre-fetching of room relations (such as departments, features, and groups) when loading the data for the Room Edit page.</line>
				<line>This fixes a potential Hibernate issue that is causing room groups and features to disappear (not get loaded) in some cases that are hard to explain or reproduce.</line>
				<line>The pre-fetching can be enabled by setting unitime.rooms.prefetchRelations to true.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Multiple Class Setup</name>
			<description>
				<line>Multiple Class Setup page rewritten to GWT to make the page faster and more reliable.</line>
				<line>To use the old (Struts2-based) page, set unitime.legacy.course.multiple_class_setup to true.</line>
				<line>When managing department is changed, only remove preferences that no longer apply (e.g., keep global room feature/group preferences).
					<line>Former behavior (clear all room-related preferences) set unitime.legacy.course.clear_preferences to true.</line>

			<name>Student Scheduling: Reservations</name>
			<description>
				<line>Student Scheduling Solver: Improved handling of reservations with restrictions from two or more configurations by computing and using configuration-specific limit caps and reservation limits.
					<line>This makes the computation of reserved and unreserved space for a config or a section much more accurate.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Online Student Scheduling: Corrected the computation of reservation limit for reservations with restrictions from two or more configurations.
					<line>This fixes an issue causing some space not to be reserved when a reservation was set between a configuration and one or more sections of a different config.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Online Student Scheduling: The checking of available space (e.g., when a student clicks Submit Schedule) for reservations with restrictions from two or more configurations has been corrected.
					<line>This is especially applicable to reservations marked as exclusive (to be checked only at the levels they are set).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Add/Edit Reservation: Corrected computation of the selected spaces when restrictions from two or more configurations are selected.</line>

			<name>Scheduling Subparts: Limit, Course Name</name>
			<description>
				<line>Do not pre-compute scheduling subpart limits and course names.</line>
				<line>This fixes an issue of showing an incorrect limit after a class limit change or when a class has been added or removed from a subpart.</line>
				<line>The drawback is that these fields are no longer available in the reports, to fix this replace
					<line>ss.limit with (select sum(c.expectedCapacity) from Class_ c where c.schedulingSubpart = s)</line>
					<line>ss.courseName with (select co.subjectAreaAbbv || ' ' || co.courseNbr from CourseOffering co where co.isControl = true and co.instructionalOffering = ss.instrOfferingConfig.instructionalOffering)</line>
				</line>
			</description>

		<item>
			<name>Multiple Class Setup</name>
			<description>
				<line>Prevent premature submission of the page by only enabling all the submit buttons after the page is fully loaded.</line>
				<line>This fixes a problem when some classes are deleted because the page is submitted for a massive course configuration while it is still being loaded.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Instructional Offering: Limit, Demand</name>
			<description>
				<line>Do not compute demand and limit fields within the data model (formula).
					<line>It does not save anve time and just complicates the query.</line>
					<line>This is to avoid showing old data, e.g., when an instructional offering configuration is updated.</line>
				</line>
				<line>The drawback is that these fields are no longer available in the reports, to fix this replace
					<line>io.limit with (select sum(ioc.limit) from InstrOfferingConfig ioc where ioc.instructionalOffering = io)</line>
					<line>io.demand with (select sum(co.demand + (case when cox is null then 0 else cox.demand end)) from CourseOffering co left outer join co.demandOffering cox where co.instructionalOffering = io)</line>
				</line>
				<line>This way, the fields are only computed when needed.</line>

			<name>Course Timetabling: Multiple Rooms Split Attendance</name>
			<description>
				<line>When a class needs two or more rooms, added an ability to set the class as requiring split attendance.</line>
				<line>When split attendance is set for the class, the class is expected to be split among the assigned rooms (the total room capacity must meet the class limit times room ratio).</line>
				<line>When split attendance is not set for the class (which is the default), each room must be big enough to fit the class.</line>
				<line>Split Attendance can be set on the Instructional Offering Configuration page (all classes of a subpart) or the Multiple Class Setup page (individual classes).</line>
			</description>

			<name>Student Scheduling Assistant / Course Requests: Access Control</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added an ability to limit how many users can use the page (Scheduling Assistant and/or Course Requests) at the same time.</line>
				<line>Automatically leave the page after a given time of inactivity (showing a warning first).</line>
				<line>Parameters for Scheduling Assistant:
					<line>unitime.accessControl.sectioning.maxActiveUsers .. Maximal number of users using the page at the same time (not set or zero for disabled).</line>
					<line>unitime.accessControl.sectioning.activeLimitInMinutes .. Number of minutes of inactivity for the user to get the Inactive Warning (defaults to 15 minutes, set to zero to disable).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Parameters for Course Requests:
					<line>unitime.accessControl.requests.maxActiveUsers .. Maximal number of users using the page at the same time (not set or zero for disabled).</line>
					<line>unitime.accessControl.requests.activeLimitInMinutes .. Number of minutes of inactivity for the user to get the Inactive Warning (defaults to 15 minutes, set to zero to disable).</line>

		<item>
			<name>Student Availability: Check Other Academic Sessions</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added an ability to check student schedules from other overlapping academic sessions.The classes of other academic sessions show up as unavailablies (blue color, not clickable).</line>
				<line>They are also used as unavailabilities: the solver would not assign a class in the current academic session to a time that conflicts with a class of some other academic session that the student has.</line>
				<line>Unless the class is of scheduling subpart that allows for overlaps, in which case the overlapping time is minimized instead.</line>
				<line>This feature is not enabled by default, to enable it set the following properties:
					<line>Batch student scheduling: set the solver parameter Load.IncludeUnavailabilitiesFromOtherSessions to true.</line>
					<line>Online student scheduling: there are two options, 
						<line>the unavailable times are either loaded from the database (when General.CheckUnavailabilitiesFromOtherSessionsUsingDatabase is true),</line>
						<line>or from the other online student scheduling solver servers (when General.CheckUnavailabilitiesFromOtherSessions is true).</line>

			<name>Hibernate 6.2 / JGroups 5.2</name>
			<description>
				<line>UniTime updated to use the latest versions of Hibernate 6.2 and JGroups 5.2.</line>
				<line>Infinispan 14 is now used for second level cache and cache replication/invalidation when there are multiple web servers.</line>
				<line>This, however, requires UniTime to use Java 11 or later (Java 8 is no longer supported).</line>
				<line>Some HQL reports may need to be updated due to the Hibernate upgrade, e.g.,
					<line>table = id no longer works (e.g., Session = %SESSION% must be changed to Session.uniqueId = %SESSION%)</line>
					<line>x is true needs to be changed to x = true</line>
					<line>function BIT_AND needs to be changed to BITAND</line>
					<line>InstructionalOffering.coordinators needs to be changed to InstructionalOffering.offeringCoordinators</line>
					<line>Assignment.classId needs to be changed to Assignment.clazz.uniqueId</line>
					<line>CourseOffering.isControl = 1 needs to be changed to CourseOffering.isControl = true</line>
					<line>mod(x, n) may need to be changed to mod(cast(x as int), n)</line>
					<line>sysdate - :days (where :days is an integer) may need to be changed to sysdate - numtodsinterval(:days, 'day')</line>
				</line>
				<line>Some Scripts may need to be updated due to the Hibernate upgrade, e.g,
					<line>Query.setLong, setString, setDate, etc., needs to be changed to setParameter</line>
					<line>QueueIn/QueueOut.setXml/getXML now takes a string (use setDocument/getDocument for XML access)</line>

					<line>Min/max credit</line>
					<line>Instructor name (given course must have a class with matching instructor name)</line>
				</line>
				<line>Notes:
					<line>Classes that do not display instructors are not considered by the instructor filter.</line>
					<line>Classes that are not enabled for student scheduling are ignored (both instructor and class dates filters).</line>
					<line>The filter is ONLY used for the list of courses, it does not guarantee that the student gets a class with the given instructor or within the given dates.</line>
					<line>When used on the Student Course Requests page or Advisor Course Recommendations page at the time when the schedule of classes has not been published yet,

			<name>Student Scheduling Rules</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added student scheduling rules that can be used to define which courses a particular group of students can request/enroll in.These rules can be defined on Administration > Other > Student Scheduling Rules page.</line>
				<line>A group of students can be a student filter (same format as on the dashboards, e.g., group:SpecialStudents or primary-major:%-OL).</line>
				<line>Each group of students can be restricted to particular course types (provided using a regular expression, e.g., !No Pre-Reg),
					course names (provided using a regular expression, e.g, .*[0-9]OL for all courses with OL suffix),
					or instructional methods (provided using a regular expression, e.g., PO|PH for course configurations with PO or PH instructional methods).
					<line>A course name or instructional method regular expression can be negated by using an exclamation mark as a prefix (e.g., !.*[0-9]OL for all courses without an OL suffix).</line>
					<line>If multiple expressions are provided (e.g., both course and instructional method), depending on the mode of the rule, all of the expressions must match or just one.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Each rule can be restricted by a regular expression matching academic initiative, a regular expression matching term, start and end year.</line>
				<line>The rules are processed in the given order.</line>
				<line>For each student, the first matching rule is used (there are no course or instructional method restrictions when no rule applies).</line>

			<name>Solver Load: Replace Pending courses with Substitutes</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to treat substitute course demands as primary when a primary course demand was skipped entirely due to one of the following reasons:
					<line>pending override request (when Load.ReplacePendingWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>canceled override request (when Load.ReplaceCancelledWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>rejected override request (when Load.ReplaceRejectedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>not offered course (when Load.ReplaceNotOfferedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
				</line>
				<line>More precisely, when a course demand is skipped (all its courses are skipped for some reason),
					and at least one of the courses is skipped due to a reason that is enabled, then
					<line>Take the top most substitute course demand and treat it as primary.</line>
					<line>The position of the substitute course is kept (it shows at the bottom of the primary requests instead of at the top of the substitutes).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Course demands that do not allow for substitutes (Wait-List or No-Sub toggle is checked) are not replaced with a substitute.</line>
