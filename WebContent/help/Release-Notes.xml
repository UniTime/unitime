		<title>Student Scheduling</title>
		<item>
			<name>Database Load: Learning Community Reservations</name>
			<description>
				<line>Corrected a minor issue with a Learning Community reservation:
					<line>
						When a course is solely reserved for a single learning community,
						and there are some students already enrolled that are not matching the provided student filter,
						the reservation limit may be updated so that it is one student less than it should be.
					</line>
				</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Log Cleaner: Published Solver Runs</name>
			<description>
				<line>Corrected the ability to automatically delete old published student scheduling solver runs during startup.</line>
				<line>Using unitime.cleanup.publishedSolutions property listing number of days after which a published run can be deleted
					(defaults to -1, no automatic delete).</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Course/Configuration Limits</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to recompute config and course limits to exclude canceled and disabled classes
					(by counting space in individual classes and decreasing the config/course limit to this number, if larger).</line>
				<line>This is only done when Load.CorrectConfigLimit is set to true (defaults to false).</line>
				<line>Student group and LC reservations that allow for disabled classes are considered (counted towards the limit).</line>
				<line>Students that are enrolled in canceled/disabled classes that are not included in the problem are considered (counted towards the limit).</line>
				<line>This is to improve performance of reservations that have no or only config-level restrictions for courses that have cancelled or disabled classes.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Student Status</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to allow Scheduling Assistant or Course Requests page to be used by an admin (or an advisor) without allowing the student to access the page.
					<line>That is, for instance, the advisor can access the Course Requests page when Advisor Register toggle is checked regardless of the Registration toggle.</line>
					<line>That is, for instance, the admin can access the Scheduling Assistant page when Admin Enroll toggle is checked regardless of the Assistant toggle.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added no-schedule status flag:
					<line>When set, student of such status cannot see his/her personal schedule for the given term
						(these include classes, exams, and course related events).</line>
				</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Critical Courses: Custom Provider</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to include all terms of the plan (when banner.dgw.criticalIncludeAllTerms is true, defaults to false).</line>

			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Use Class Snapshot Limits</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to use class snapshot limit (e.g., for the test runs)
					<line>when Load.UseSnapShotLimits is set to true (defaults to false).</line>
				</line>
				<line>When a class has a snapshot limit defined and it is above the class limit &gt;&gt; use snapshot limit instead of the class limit.</line>
				<line>Compute snapshot limit on configurations and offerings (using class snapshot limits, defaulting to class limits for classes with no snapshot limit defined).</line>
 			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Student Scheduling: Advisors</name>
			<description>
				<line>Show student's advisor(s) on the dashboard page (Students tab) and in the Enrollments tables.</line>
