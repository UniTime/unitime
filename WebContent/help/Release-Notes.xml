			<name>Solver Load: Replace Pending courses with Substitutes</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to treat substitute course demands as primary when a primary course demand was skipped entirely due to one of the following reasons:
					<line>pending override request (when Load.ReplacePendingWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>canceled override request (when Load.ReplaceCancelledWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>rejected override request (when Load.ReplaceRejectedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>not offered course (when Load.ReplaceNotOfferedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
				</line>
				<line>More precisely, when a course demand is skipped (all its courses are skipped for some reason),
					and at least one of the courses is skipped due to a reason that is enabled, then
					<line>Take the top most substitute course demand and treat it as primary.</line>
					<line>The position of the substitute course is kept (it shows at the bottom of the primary requests instead of at the top of the substitutes).</line>
				</line>

			<name>Hibernate 6.2 / JGroups 5.2</name>
			<description>
				<line>UniTime updated to use the latest versions of Hibernate 6.2 and JGroups 5.2.</line>
				<line>Infinispan 14 is now used for second level cache and cache replication/invalidation when there are multiple web servers.</line>
