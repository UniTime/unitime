				</line>
				<line>So, when the default is true and it is not changed on the offering, show that the offering is being wait-listed.
					<line>This allows to always check and show wait-listing problems (e.g., course is wait-listed and allows for closed section overrides at the same time).</line>

		<title>Online Student Scheduling: Wait-Listing</title>
		<item>
			<name>Configuration</name>
			<description>
				<line>Only certain courses may be enabled for wait-listing (there is a toggle on the Edit Course Offering page).
					<line>By default, only selected courses can be wait-listed. This can be changed using unitime.offering.waitListDefault which defaults to false.</line>
					<line>Certain overrides can be disabled for wait-listed courses (using unitime.offering.waitList.prohibitedOverride).
						<line>For example, a student should not be allowed to request a class limit override for a course that can be wait-listed.</line>
					</line>
				</line>
				<line>There is now a different toggle for wait-listing (Wait-List) and for just indicating that a course cannot be substituted (No-Subs).
					<line>A student (Course Requests, Scheduling Assistant) can use one or the other, based on the student status.</line>
					<line>An advisor (Course Recommendations) can use one or the other, based on the unitime.acr.waitlist setting (defaults to None) or based on the student status.</line>
				</line>

			<name>Student Scheduling Assistant</name>
			<description>
				<line>An additional information about wait-listed courses is displayed, in the Wait-Listed Courses section (shown when at least one course is wait-listed).</line>
				<line>As only some course can be wait-listed, the Wait-List checkbox is only available if the first-choice course can be wait-listed.</line>
				<line>There is a warning when a wait-listed course overlaps with the rest of the schedule.</line>
			</description>

				<line>Various improvements in the filtering for wait-listed courses.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Custom Validation</name>
			<description>
				<line>A custom validation of the wait-listed course requests can be implemented using the WaitListValidationProvider class.
					<line>The validation does work similarly to pre-registration, using a test schedule, but doing one course at a time on top of the existing schedule.</line>
					<line>It may include max credit overrides.</line>
				</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>

					<line>Can be enabled by setting solver configuration parameter Enrollment.ReSchedulingEnabled to true.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Students wait-listed for a course are processed in the following order:
					<line>Course request priority (critical courses) first, student priority second, wait-listed time stamp last.</line>
					<line>Students with a pending override, a time conflict, or students over max credit are skipped.</line>
					<line>The order can be customized (e.g., only be based on the wait-listed time stamp)</line>
				</line>
				<line>Email notifications added when custom enrollment fails (it is not possible to enroll student because of registration error).</line>
				<line>Wait-list toggle is no longer automatically enabled when a student attempts to enroll to a course that is currently locked.</line>
