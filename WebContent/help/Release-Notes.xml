			<description>
				<line>Course Requests With Projected Last Likes: added ability to combine pre-registration (course requests) with projected last-like course enrollment data.
					<line>Course Requests take precedence, Last-Likes are weighted to fill the remaining space based on the curriculum projection rules.</line>
				</line>

					<line>Alternatives are either ignored (when StudentCourseRequests.IncludeAlternatives is false).</line>
					<line>Student weight is spread between the requested course and its alternatives, student conflicts between
						alternatives are ignored (when StudentCourseRequests.IncludeAlternatives is true, which is the default).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Curricula Requests Course Demands: improved ability to consider course request alternatives.
					<line>Alternatives are either ignored (when StudentCourseRequests.IncludeAlternatives is false).
						Course requests are included in the curriculum problem.</line>
					<line>Student weight is spread between the requested course and its alternatives, student conflicts between alternatives are
						ignored (when StudentCourseRequests.IncludeAlternatives is true, which is the default).
						While course requests (without alternatives) are included in the curriculum, true requests with alternatives
						are used in the timetabling for students that are not made up.</line>
